# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and experience as a Lead Frontend Developer. The site is built using Next.js and Firebase to deliver a fast, scalable, and interactive user experience.

## Introduction

This portfolio website serves as a comprehensive showcase of my work, skills, and projects. It is designed to provide potential employers, clients, and collaborators with an in-depth look at my expertise in frontend development, particularly with Next.js and Firebase. I have not only created a functional portfolio website, however I have created an authenticated user dashboard, and admin area that supports it. This allows me to easily create blog posts, and manage content. With more features to come in the future.

## Current Features

 - Responsive Design: Optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
 - Dynamic Content: Projects and skills are dynamically loaded from Firebase. I can create, edit, and publish blog posts. There is also the functionality for creating draft posts.
 - Fast Performance: Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. I have implemented some best practices for asset optimisation and delivery.
 - Authentication: Secure user authentication using Firebase Auth.
 - SEO Friendly: Optimized for search engines to increase visibility.

## Future features

In future, I plan on adding the following features to this repo:
 - Automated tests
 - Manage / Edit Projects
 - Blog post comments (Google / FB sign in methods)
 - Dynamically add icons to Blog Post Tags
 - Update / Edit alt tags on blog post featured images
